GEOFFREY CHAUCER. 1328-1400.,Canterbury Tales. Prologue. Line 1.,"UNIVERSITY PRESS: JOHN WILSON AND SON, CAMBRIDGE, U.S.A. THE MEMORY OF THE LATE ASSISTANT EDITOR, ""Out of the old fieldes cometh al this new corne fro yere to yere,"" And out of the fresh woodes cometh al these new flowres here. THE small thin volume, the first to bear the title of this collection, after passing through eight editions, each enlarged, now culminates in its ninth,--and with it, closes its tentative life. This extract from the Preface of the fourth edition is applicable to the present one:-- ""It is not easy to determine in all cases the degree of familiarity that may belong to phrases and sentences which present themselves for admission; for what is familiar to one class of readers may be quite new to another. Many maxims of the most famous writers of our language, and numberless curious and happy turns from orators and poets, have knocked at the door, and it was hard to deny them. But to admit these simply on their own merits, without assurance that the general reader would readily recognize them as old friends, was aside from the purpose of this collection. Still, it has been thought better to incur the risk of erring on the side of fulness."" With the many additions to the English writers, the present edition contains selections from the French, and from the wit and wisdom of the ancients. A few passages have been admitted without a claim to familiarity, but solely on the ground of coincidence of thought. I am under great obligations to M. H. MORGAN, Ph. D., of Harvard University, for the translation of Marcus Aurelius, and for the translation and selections from the Greek tragic writers. I am indebted to the kindness of Mr. DANIEL W. WILDER, of Kansas, for the quotations from Pilpay, with contributions from Diogenes Laertius, Montaigne, Burton, and Pope's Homer; to Dr. WILLIAM J. ROLFE for quotations from Robert Browning; to Mr. JAMES W. MCINTYRE for quotations from Coleridge, Shelley, Keats, Mrs. Browning, Robert Browning, and Tennyson. And I have incurred other obligations to friends for here a little and there a little. It gives me pleasure to acknowledge the great assistance I have received from Mr. A. W. STEVENS, the accomplished reader of the University Press, as this work was passing through the press. In withdrawing from this very agreeable pursuit, I beg to offer my sincere thanks to all who have assisted me either in the way of suggestions or by contributions; and especially to those lovers of this subsidiary literature for their kind appreciation of former editions. Accepted by scholars as an authoritative book of reference, it has grown with its growth in public estimation with each reissue. Of the last two editions forty thousand copies were printed, apart from the English reprints. The present enlargement of text equals three hundred and fifty pages of the previous edition, and the index is increased with upwards of ten thousand lines. CAMBRIDGE, March, 1891.

At first the infant, Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms. And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel And shining morning face, creeping like snail Unwillingly to school. And then the lover, Sighing like furnace, with a woful ballad Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier, Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard; Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel, Seeking the bubble reputation Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice, In fair round belly with good capon lined, With eyes severe and beard of formal cut, Full of wise saws and modern instances; And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon, With spectacles on nose and pouch on side; His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice, Turning again toward childish treble, pipes And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all, That ends this strange eventful history, Is second childishness and mere oblivion, Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything."

FRANCIS BACON. 1561-1626.,Of Gardens.,"And because the breath of flowers is far sweeter in the air (where it comes and goes, like the warbling of music) than in the hand, therefore nothing is more fit for that delight than to know what be the flowers and plants that do best perfume the air."

Another song, entitled ""Though lost to Sight, to Memory dear,"" was published in London in 1880, purporting to have been ""written by Ruthven Jenkyns in 1703."" It is said to have been published in the ""Magazine for Mariners."" No such magazine, however, ever existed, and the composer of the music acknowledged, in a private letter, to have copied the song from an American newspaper. There is no other authority for the origin of this song, and the reputed author, Ruthven Jenkyns, was living, under the name of C----, in California in 1882.

The lightnings may flash and the loud thunders rattle; He heeds not, he hears not, he 's free from all pain; He sleeps his last sleep, he has fought his last battle; No sound can awake him to glory again![666-1]"
LEONARD HEATH.,The Grave of Bonaparte.,"Yet spirit immortal, the tomb cannot bind thee, But like thine own eagle that soars to the sun Thou springest from bondage and leavest behind thee A name which before thee no mortal hath won. Tho' nations may combat, and war's thunders rattle, No more on thy steed wilt thou sweep o'er the plain: Thou sleep'st thy last sleep, thou hast fought thy last battle, No sound can awake thee to glory again."

Referring perhaps to this maxim of Bion, Plutarch says in his Life of Cleomenes (c. 27), ""He who first called money the sinews of the state seems to have said this with special reference to war."" Accordingly we find money called expressly ta neura tou polemou, ""the sinews of war,"" in Libanius, Orat. xlvi. (vol. ii. p. 477, ed. Reiske), and by the scholiast on Pindar, Olymp. i. 4 (compare Photius, Lex. _s. v._ Meganoros plouton). So Cicero, Philipp. v. 2, ""nervos belli, infinitam pecuniam.""

A Scotch law-phrase,--an accessory before and after the fact.

From the inscription upon the façade of the house at Harlem formerly occupied by Laurent Koster (or Coster), who is charged, among others, with the invention of printing. Mention is first made of this inscription about  1628:-- MEMORIÆ SACRUM As gingerly. CHAPMAN: _May Day._ SHAKESPEARE: _Two Gentlemen of Verona._ Be sure you are right, then go ahead. The motto of David Crockett in the war of 1812. Before you could say Jack Robinson. This current phrase is said to be derived from a humorous song by Hudson, a tobacconist in Shoe Lane, London.

HALLIWELL: _Archæological Dictionary._ (Cited from an old Play.) Begging the question. This is a common logical fallacy, _petitio principii_; and the first explanation of the phrase is to be found in Aristotle's ""Topica,"" viii. 13, where the five ways of begging the question are set forth. The earliest English work in which the expression is found is ""The Arte of Logike plainlie set forth in our English Tongue, &c."" (1584.) Better to wear out than to rust out. When a friend told Bishop Cumberland (1632-1718) he would wear himself out by his incessant application, ""It is better,"" replied the Bishop, ""to wear out than to rust out.""--HORNE: _Sermon on the Duty of Contending for the Truth._ BOSWELL: _Tour to the Hebrides, p. 18, note._ Beware of a man of one book.

The true phrase, ""better end,"" is used properly to designate a crisis, or the moment of an extremity. When in a gale a vessel has paid out all her cable, her cable has run out to the ""better end,""--the end which is secured within the vessel and little used. Robinson Crusoe in describing the terrible storm in Yarmouth Roads says, ""We rode with two anchors ahead, and the cables veered out to the better end."" Cockles of the heart.

This is a proverbial phrase found throughout English literature, the first instance noted being in Sir Philip Sidney's ""Defence of Poesy."" Consistency, thou art a jewel. This is one of those popular sayings--like ""Be good, and you will be happy,"" or ""Virtue is its own reward""--that, like Topsy, ""never _was_ born, only jist growed."" From the earliest times it has been the popular tendency to call this or that cardinal virtue, or bright and shining excellence, a jewel, by way of emphasis. For example, Iago  says,-- ""_Good name_, in man or woman, dear my lord, Is the immediate _jewel_ of their souls."" Shakespeare elsewhere calls _experience_ a ""jewel."" Miranda says her _modesty_ is the ""jewel"" in her dower; and in ""All 's Well that ends Well,"" Diana terms her _chastity_ the ""jewel"" of her house.--R. A. WIGHT. O discretion, thou art a jewel!--_The Skylark, a Collection of well-chosen English Songs._ (London, 1772.) The origin of this expression is unknown. Some wag of the day allayed public curiosity in regard to its source with the information that it is from the ballad of Robin Roughhead in Murtagh's ""Collection of Ballads (1754)."" It is needless to say that Murtagh is a verbal phantom, and the ballad of Robin Roughhead first appeared in an American newspaper in 1867.

""Dead as Chelsea, by God!"" an exclamation uttered by a grenadier at Fontenoy, on having his leg carried away by a cannon-ball.--_Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue_, 1758 (quoted by Brady, ""Varieties of Literature,"" 1826). Die in the last ditch. To William of Orange may be ascribed this saying. When Buckingham urged the inevitable destruction which hung over the United Provinces, and asked him whether he did not see that the commonwealth was ruined, ""There is one certain means,"" replied the Prince, ""by which I can be sure never to see my country's ruin,--I will die in the last ditch.""--HUME: _History of England._ (1622.)

The title of an article in the ""Boston Centinel,"" July 12, 1817. Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty. It is the common fate of the indolent to see their rights become a prey to the active. The condition upon which God hath given liberty to man is eternal vigilance; which condition if he break, servitude is at once the consequence of his crime and the punishment of his guilt.--JOHN PHILPOT CURRAN: _Speech upon the Right of Election, 1790._ (_Speeches.

According to Brady (""Clavis Calendaria""), this designation arose from the fact that in an old romance a prince of the name of Crispin is made to exercise, in honour of his namesake, Saint Crispin, the trade of shoemaking. There is a tradition that King Edward IV., in one of his disguises, once drank with a party of shoemakers, and pledged them. The story is alluded to in the old play of ""George a-Greene""  (1599):-- Marry, because you have drank with the King, And the King hath so graciously pledged you, You shall no more be called shoemakers; But you and yours, to the world's end, Shall be called the trade of the gentle craft.

Sardonic smile. The island of Sardinia, consisting chiefly of marshes and mountains, has from the earliest period to the present been cursed with a noxious air, an ill-cultivated soil, and a scanty population. The convulsions produced by its poisonous plants gave rise to the expression of sardonic smile, which is as old as Homer (Odyssey, xx. 302).--MAHON: _History of England, vol. i. p. 287._ The explanation given by Mahon of the meaning of ""sardonic smile"" is to be sure the traditional one, and was believed in by the late classical writers. But in the Homeric passage referred to, the word is ""sard_a_nion"" (sardanion), not ""sard_o_nion."" There is no evidence that Sardinia was known to the composers of what we call Homer. It looks as though the word was to be connected with the verb sairô, ""show the teeth;"" ""grin like a dog;"" hence that the ""sardonic smile"" was a ""grim laugh.""--M. H. MORGAN.
